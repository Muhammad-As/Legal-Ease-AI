- Clarify Python version:
  - Code uses `str | None` union types requiring Python 3.10+. Keep README at Python 3.10+.
- Add OCR fallback (optional enhancement):
  - Integrate `pytesseract` + `pdf2image` when PyPDF2 returns no text.
- Add request size limits and PDF validation:
  - FastAPI `UploadFile` size checks; reject non-PDF content types; handle >N MB gracefully.
- Streaming responses for long computations:
  - Consider server-sent events (SSE) for progressive UI updates.
- Caching & rate limiting:
  - Cache LLM results per file hash; apply simple rate limiting for public deployments.
- Security:
  - Ensure that uploaded files are not stored persistently; scan for malware if you introduce disk writes.
- Observability:
  - Add request logging and basic metrics (Prometheus/OTel) in production.
- Frontend polish:
  - Drag-n-drop upload, progress bars, skeleton loaders.
  - Persist Q&A history in sessionStorage/localStorage.
  - Add file size/type hints and graceful empty states.
- CI/CD:
  - Add GitHub Actions for lint/type checks and formatting.
- Testing:
  - Backend: unit tests for chunking, JSON cleaning, and prompt builders.
  - Frontend: component tests for UploadCard and pages.
